These tests are based on those at http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/misc/smarten-test.html.

I have modified them.

Some of the tests are failing (see if you can find them), but I would need a context-free parser --- and not just regexes --- to solve this.

# Tests: single quotes

* Let's look at two apostrophe's [sic].

* Let's look at three apostrophes: won't, shouldn't.

* I haven't tried ('parentheses' yet).

* I haven't tried ('parentheses') yet.

* What about '(parentheses)'?.

* And '[brackets]'?.

* I haven't tried ['brackets' yet].

* I haven't tried ['brackets'] yet.

* What about slashes/'virgules'?

* And {'curly' braces}?

---

# Tests: double quotes

* A double quote---"within" dashes---would be nice.

* A double quote---"within dashes"---would be nice.

* I haven't tried ("parentheses" yet).

* I haven't tried ("parentheses") yet.

* What about "(parentheses)"?.

* And "[brackets]"?.

* I haven't tried ["brackets" yet].

* I haven't tried ["brackets"] yet.

* What about slashes/"virgules"?

* And {"curly" braces}?

# Tests: nested quotes

"'Let's try "nested" quotes,' he said."


---

# Tests: dashes

* From pages 1--3.

* I don't know---he said.

* ---No!

  ---Yes!

---

# Tests: ellipsis

* And now... 

* ...the end is near

---

# Misc

* "'Twas the night before Christmas..." with a straight apostrophe.

* "â€˜Twas the night before Christmas..." with an explicit curly apostrophe.

---

# Code

* Punctuation in code blocks and their output cannot be changed:

```{r}
chars <- c('a', 'b', 'c', '...', '--', '---')

chars
```

* This also goes for inline stuff, like `---, --, "a", 'a', ...`

  Compare ---, --, "a", 'a', ...

---

# Pre

* Punctuation in `pre` blocks cannot be changed:

```
---, --, "a", 'a', ...
```

---

# Mathjax

* I do not want primes or dashes replaced in display math:

$$'x' = y'' \leq x--; 
x; 
x''...; 
\dots$$

* and certainly not in inline math: $x' = y'' \leq x--;$.

* In display math neither the opening `$$` nor the closing `$$` can be in lines by themselves. 

* Ideally, as Yihui Xie recommends [here](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/82#issuecomment-343957854), from the initial `$$` to the final `$$`, it should all be one line.
